## 3.18.0
### Added
* Code-level metrics are now available for instrumented transactions. This is off by default but once enabled via `ConfigCodeLevelMetricsEnabled(true)` transactions will include information about the location in the source code where `StartTransaction` was invoked.
   * Adds information about where in your source code transaction traces originated.
   * See the Go agent documentation for details on [configuring](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/configuration/go-agent-code-level-metrics-config) code-level metrics and how to [instrument](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/instrumentation/go-agent-code-level-metrics-instrument) your code using them.
* New V2 logs-in-context plugin is available for Logrus, packed with all the features you didn't know you wanted:
   * Automatic log forwarding
   * Log metrics
   * Capture logs anywhere in your code; both inside or outside of a transaction.
   * Use the Logrus formatting package of your choice
   * Local log decorating is now available for the new logcontext-v2/nrlogrus plugin only. This is off by default but can be enabled with `ConfigAppLogForwardingEnabled(true)`.

### Fixed
 * Fixed issue with custom event limits and number of distributed tracing spans to more accurately follow configured limits.

### Support Statement
New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that youâ€™re getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach end-of-life.
* Note that the oldest supported version of the Go agent is 3.6.0.
